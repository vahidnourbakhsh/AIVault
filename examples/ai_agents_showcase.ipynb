    "\n",
    "**AI Agents** are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perception**: Understanding inputs and context\n",
    "2. **Reasoning**: Planning and decision-making\n",
    "3. **Action**: Using tools and making changes\n",
    "4. **Learning**: Adapting based on feedback\n",

    "- **Basic Agent Architecture**: Understanding agents as autonomous systems\n",
    "- **ReAct Pattern**: Reasoning and Acting cycles\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: How agents use external tools\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents\n",
    "- **Memory and Context**: Maintaining state across interactions\n",
    "- **Custom Tools**: Extending agent capabilities\n",
    "- **Real-World Applications**: Practical use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of AI Agents:\n",
    "1. **Autonomy**: Can work independently with minimal supervision\n",
    "2. **Tool Use**: Can leverage external resources and APIs\n",
    "3. **Reasoning**: Can break down complex problems\n",
    "4. **Adaptability**: Can handle diverse tasks with the same framework\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: Multi-agent systems can handle complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Integrate with real LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)\n",
    "- Add more sophisticated planning algorithms\n",
